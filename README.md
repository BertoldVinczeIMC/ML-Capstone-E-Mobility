# E-Mobility

## Introduction
This project was made for an assignment in the course Data Science Capstone Project at the IMC University of Applied Sciences Krems. Dataset was provided by [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html). The data is owned by Siemens and is not publicly available.

## Goal
Our main goals
were to identify charging events, group them to make them easier to comprehend,
and look for any relationships between charging patterns and the days of the week.
We wanted to learn important things about how EV charging works so we could
tailor the charging infrastructure. To do this, we mostly looked at wallbox data.
